# Mermaid Monkey Brand Generation

Generated with `higgsfield generate create imagegen_2_0` on 2026-05-30.

## Decision

- Mascot-led hero: chosen because the character is the differentiator and the third candidate clearly interacts with graph nodes.
- Demo theme set: Narrative and Blueprint only, because those are the two real v1 layout engines. The other philosophy names are not advertised as dedicated layouts on the landing page.
- Site tech: vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript on Vite in `packages/site`, reusing the same `@mermaid-render/core` public API as the demo harness.
- Site location: workspace package at `packages/site`, deployed by GitHub Pages Actions from its static build output.
- Domain: GitHub Pages default subpath, canonical `https://arunjrk.github.io/mermaid-render/`.

## Chosen Assets

- Mascot: `packages/site/public/brand/mascot.png`
  - Job id: `efdd73ed-2940-4293-9230-2e08635c035f`
  - Reason: strongest diagram interaction cue, clean body silhouette, no visible extra limbs.
- Glyph: `packages/site/public/brand/glyph.png`
  - Job id: `eaa95dc6-8d98-45f5-ad3a-70cb43e2a9aa`
  - Reason: simplest tail-as-flow mark, legible as a small favicon.
