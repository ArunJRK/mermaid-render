# mermaid-render Backlog

Central tracking for all pending work. Ordered by priority within each section.

## P0 — Critical (Blocks Usability)

- [ ] **Narrative flow lanes** — Detect longest path as spine. Decision nodes split: Yes→right, No→left. After merge, return to center. Currently all philosophies use same dagre layout.
- [ ] **Map force-directed layout** — Add d3-force dependency. Implement force simulation with attraction, repulsion, cluster gravity. Replace dagre for Map philosophy.
- [ ] **Blueprint visual identity** — Grid background (#001a33 with #003366 lines at 20px), monospace font (JetBrains Mono via BitmapFont), actual blueprint blue colors, grid-snap node positions.
- [ ] **Blueprint edge collision avoidance** — Straight/diagonal lines that route around nodes when they would intersect. Physics-based path finding.
- [ ] **Edge routing quality** — Current edges are straight spaghetti lines. Need bezier curves for Narrative, bundled curves for Map, straight+collision for Blueprint, whisper lines for Breath.
- [ ] **Spring animation on state changes** — Philosophy switch, fold/unfold, focus navigation, fitToView should all use spring physics easing. PixiJS ticker-based spring formula.

## P1 — Important (Improves Experience)

- [ ] **Breath whisper lines** — Edges at 1px, 0.3 opacity. Edge labels hidden by default, shown on hover.
- [ ] **Breath 3-4x spacing** — Larger nodes (200x60), bigger fonts (18px), massive gaps. Presentation mode.
- [ ] **Radial layout** — New philosophy. Central node with concentric rings. Curved arc edges. d3-hierarchy or custom radial positioning.
- [ ] **Mosaic layout** — New philosophy. Masonry card grid. No visible edges. Proximity = connection. 300x100 cards.
- [ ] **Focus dim modes** — Provide all 4 as toggleable options: fade, hide, blur, push-to-edges.
- [ ] **Collapsed card mini preview** — Folded subgraphs show tiny dot-layout of internal structure (thumbnail).
- [ ] **@rank directive enforcement** — Force nodes to same y-coordinate in layout.
- [ ] **@pin directive enforcement** — Lock node at fixed position, layout flows around it.
- [ ] **Swimlanes for Map** — Detect lane-like subgraph arrangements, render divider lines.

## P2 — Polish

- [ ] **Orthogonal edges option** — Right-angle routing with rounded corners for Blueprint.
- [ ] **Edge bundling for Map** — Multiple edges between same cluster pair merge visually.
- [ ] **Hover connection highlight** — Hovering a node highlights all its edges and connected nodes.
- [ ] **Zoom animation on philosophy switch** — Crossfade between old and new rendering.
- [ ] **Breathing simulation for Map** — Force sim stays alive, nodes gently drift.
- [ ] **BitmapText at arbitrary zoom** — Re-render font atlas at higher resolution when zoom exceeds 4x.
- [ ] **Minimap** — Small overview in corner showing full diagram with viewport rectangle.

## P3 — Future

- [ ] **Inline editing** — Add/modify nodes visually.
- [ ] **Real-time collaboration** — Multi-user editing via CRDT.
- [ ] **Export to image/PDF** — Render to PNG/SVG/PDF.
- [ ] **Custom themes** — User-defined color palettes beyond the 6 philosophies.
- [ ] **Accessibility** — Parallel ARIA tree for screen readers.
- [ ] **Server-side rendering** — Headless rendering for CI/thumbnails.
